      "   - The ACTIVE PLAYER: the one whose turn it is and who may play cards.\n",
      "   - The OPPONENT: the one who may Challenge or Pass after the play.\n",
      "4. On the ACTIVE PLAYER's turn, they may play zero or more cards face-down.\n",
      "   - A truthful play: all played cards match the REQUIRED RANK (or the ACTIVE PLAYER plays zero cards).\n",
      "   - A lying play: at least one played card does NOT match the REQUIRED RANK.\n",
      "5. After the ACTIVE PLAYER plays, the OPPONENT chooses to Challenge or Pass.\n",
      "6. If the OPPONENT Challenges:\n",
      "   a. If the ACTIVE PLAYER played at least one card AND any card does NOT match the REQUIRED RANK:\n",
      "      - The ACTIVE PLAYER is the liar.\n",

      "      - The OPPONENT is the liar for making an invalid challenge.\n",
      "      - The OPPONENT picks up the pile.\n",
      "7. If the OPPONENT Passes, the pile stays, and the REQUIRED RANK increments for the next turn.\n",
      "8. The pile always resets when a player picks it up.\n",
      "9. The game ends when a player has zero cards and does not have to pick up the pile.\n",
